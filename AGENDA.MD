# Agenda

## 04/03/2024
[ ] - Discussed main points of interest we can focus: runtime efficiency, output binary filesize, memory footprint
[ ] - Decided on imperative paradigm
[ ] - Decided on transpiler -> compiled -> machine code architecture
[ ] - Created some simple syntax for: variable declaration and if statements
[ ] - Need to decide on using a compiled language: C or Rust
[ ] - Need to decide on using a higher-level transpiler language: Python or Haskell
[ ] - Discussed testing our code on live IoT device: ESP32 or RaspberryPi
### Notes
The background story is just IoT
but the main point is lightweight programming language

We need the problem deifinition/ problem statement

IoT testing comes last, we can virtualise the hardware

Investigate the languages we use

Introduction, motivation, related works in the report and then send to supervisor

In the report, short example programs to illustrate syntax to get the reader attention with visualisation of code

## 18/03/2024
[ ] - Discuss about created problem statement
[ ] - Discuss about SLY Python syntax&parser library
[ ] - Show working code

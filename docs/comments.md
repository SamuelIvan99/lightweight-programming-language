# Comments

Comments are non-executable lines in the code that are used to provide explanations or annotations. They are ignored by the transpiler and serve as a form of documentation for the code. Comments are crucial for making code more understandable to other programmers and to your future self.

comments start with `#` and continue until the end of the line. Anything after `#` on the same line is considered a comment and is ignored by the compiler or interpreter.

In Based, you can use comments like:

```
# This is a single-line comment
i32 x = 10; # This is also a single-line comment
```

Comments are useful for explaining the purpose of variables, functions, or blocks of code, as well as for temporarily disabling code without deleting it. They contribute to code readability and maintainability by providing additional context and explanations.
